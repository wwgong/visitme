## Agenda ##

**Sharing Contact Information**

First thing to do is to gather contact info from everyone.

**Name**

Client says we don't need .com domain for this project. Don't need to confirm VisitMe with client if we choose it.

**Google Code**

Can set up once professor agrees with using VisitMe as the project name.

Things to do once we have Google Code set up:

  * Schedule (move all existing items online)
  * Vision Statement
  * Risk Analysis


**Technology**

Small talk about how Facebook apps work, plus discussing languages and APIs used.

  * PHP http://www.php.net
  * MySQL http://www.mysql.com
  * Smarty http://www.smarty.net
  * Facebook API http://developers.facebook.com
  * Kayak API http://www.kayak.com/labs/api/search/

## Conclusions ##

We decided we need a team name and a vision statement, both of which we can all put in contributions to.

Any and all other conclusions are reflected in the [schedule](Schedule.md)

## Absentees ##

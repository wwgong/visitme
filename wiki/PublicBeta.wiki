#summary Description of how we will go public
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
Any application on a social network is pointless if people do not use it. It is for this reason that we will have to get as many people as possible to test VisitMe. During development the application is not visible to the general public, only the developers can test it.

= Details =
While the temptation is strong to let people try it out as soon as we have _anything_ running, there are several things that must be done before we can deploy the application to more users:

  * Application must be relatively stable
  * The core functionality must be complete
  * We need to make sure we have access rights to make a large number of API calls
  * User feedback
  * Privacy policy
  * Help documentation
  * Terms of service

Facebook allows the developers to keep track of how many people are using the application, as well as how many people have used it in the past month.


= Procedure on Facebook =
Going public involves one simple step - submitting the application to the directory.

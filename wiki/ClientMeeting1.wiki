#summary Summary of the first client meeting

Meeting took place on 10/07/2009 at Kayak with Paul English and Jim Giza.

== Summary ==

In this meeting, Paul discussed the basic idea of the facebook application "VisitMe" that 
he want us to develop it for Kayak. Also, he suggested us to learn and get used to following things:

  * Facebook API
  * Kayak API
  * Photoshop
  * Developing some small applications that are not related to "VisitMe" project
  * Usability testing and market research software: Morae (recommended)

We also talked about the distributing and documenting of the roles within the team.
Paul suggested us to change the Team Name "Flying-Pandas" because "dashes are stupid and lead to typos", so we decided to come up with a new team name which can be a domain name too.

Paul also discussed about the future extensions of this project "Spring Break".

All items and deadlines are detailed in the [Schedule schedule]

#summary Paul goes to VisitME (search)

= Introduction =

One day, Paul went to his Facebook page and looked at his friends' updates. He saw Jim's pictures taken on his trip to the White Mountains, New Hampshire for autumn foliage. Paul realized that autumn in New England is so beautiful. So he decided to visit Jim, and to see the foliage this season in Jim's place. 

Upon going to the VisitME application, Paul entered his friend's name in the search bar. VisitME showed him the cheapest price he could get instantly. It was $453 from Houston, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts. He thought the price was quite expensive for him, so he decided to put the idea away for a bit. Three days later he did the same search and noted that the price went down to $268, which was very reasonable. Very excited, he booked the ticket right away. One week later, he had a great time during the peak of autumn foliage in the White Mountains with his friends.

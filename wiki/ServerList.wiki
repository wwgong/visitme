#The following is the server list that we will use them for testing, deploying, and running our VisitME application.


=Server List=

==Primary Server==
  * Account owner: Kayak
  * Location: http://www.kayak.com

==Backup Server==
  * Account owner: Department of Computer Science, UMass Boston
  * Location: http://www.fatcow.com
 
==~~Test Server~~==
  * ~~Account owner: Department of Computer Science, UMass Boston~~
  * ~~Location: http://pele.cs.umb.edu~~

Reason: The machine is not visible for machine outside campus for technical reason. We are unable to get support from the person in charge in the department. We sent an email but never heard back. In the end, we conclude it is not worth our effort to continue pursuit the issue because the fatcow server seems sufficient. In the future, if there is a real need to an extra server, we will go back again to this problem.

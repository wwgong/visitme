Risk Analysis

<br><br>
= *Human* =

== Client ==
=== _Client unavailable (sick)_ ===
||		||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||Two weeks	||5/10		||0/10		||Postphone client meetings.||
||Until May	||0/10		||4/10		||We can communicate with the client remotely, or if they really can't communicate we will contact other people at Kayak that know what we are doing.||

=== _Client unavailable (leaves Kayak)_ ===
    * Probability: 0/10
    * Severity: 8/10
    * Possible solution: We will be left without a client, but we can continue the project independently, since Kayak API is open.

=== _Client doesn't want VisitME_ ===
    * Probability: 2/10
    * Severity: 2/10
    * Possible solution
        * Default: Client will give us another project to do.
        * No more projects: We will be left without a client, but we can continue the project independently, since Kayak API is open.

<br>
== Team ==
=== _Team (sick)_ ===
||			||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||1 person	||10/10			||1/10		||Reassign tasks to other team members or reschedule.	||
||1 role	||4/10			||6/10		||Reschedule tasks until at least one person on the role is available.	||
||Whole Team||1/10			||10/10		||Reschedule until each role has one person to do it.	||

=== _Team (can't continue at UMB)_ ===
||			||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||1 person	||1/10			||3/10		||Reassign tasks to other team members or reschedule.	||
||1 role	||0/10			||7/10		||Other people on the team have to cover the role.		||
||Whole Team||0/10			||10/10		||None, project is dead.								||

<br><br><br>
= *Servers* =

== Servers go down ==
=== _One day to one week_ ===
||			||Probability	||Severity 	||Possible solution||
||Google	||1/10			||2/10		||No big deal. Code freezes are at least a week before final presentations. We have backups of all documentation on local machines.||
||Facebook	||4/10			||2/10		||In the middle of project, reschedule test tasks; after published, wait until Facebook available.||
||Kayak		||5/10			||4/10		||In the middle of project, reschedule coding tasks; after published, stop service temporarily.||
||Internet	||1/10			||2/10		||Meet physically or communicate via telephone instead of internet among team members and client; backup all documentation and synchronize code on local machines temporarily.||

=== _Longer than one week_ ===
||			||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||Google	||1/10			||5/10		||Have to set up another SVN repository, possibly on the unix system at UMB.||
||Facebook	||2/10			||4/10		||In the middle of coding/testing stage, have to reschedule tasks; otherwise, no big deal.||
||Kayak		||3/10			||4/10		||In the middle of coding/testing stage, set up a server on unix system at UMB; after published, stop VisitME service on Facebook temporarily.||
||Internet	||0/10			||8/10		||In the middle of project, can meet physically or via phone and backup documentations and synchronize code on local machines, but have to wait for testing.||

= *Technology* = 

== API Upgrade ==
=== _Sudden API upgrade (Facebook)_ ===
    * Probability: 4/10
    * Severity: 3/10
    * Possible solution
	    * Downward compatibility(likely): Nothing need to fix
	    * Otherwise: Retest the whole project and rewrite necessary part.

=== _Sudden API upgrade (Kayak)_ ===
    * Probability: 4/10
    * Severity: 4/10
    * Possible solution
	    * Default: Client would inform us at least one month before they release new API, so we have enough time for adjustment.
	    * Otherwise: If it is downward compatible, we can choose optimize our code or do nothing; if not, retest the whole project and rewrite necessary part.


<br><br><br>
= *Other* =
=== _Natural disaster = combination of people and server problems_ ===
    * Probability: 1/10
    * Severity: 10/10
    * Possible solution: Nothing we can do.

=== _VisitME kind of application already exists_ ===
    * Probability: 5/10
    * Severity: 4/10
    * Possible solution: Extend functionality, and improve UI design and query efficiency.

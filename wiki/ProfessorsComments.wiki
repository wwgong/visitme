#summary Space for Professor Bolker to inform the team of how awesome it is.

December 12.

Browsing the code, I found the location of the VisitMe server and database and the database username and password hard coded in the php config file. That feels wrong to me. It should be easy to keep this information external, private, and supplied at installation time - i.e. when you move the php to the server. The readme file for deployment can explain it all.

I've entered this an an issue, too.

OK I've responded to Henrik's invitation and joined facebook. What I've seen so far confirms my impression that this is not a place where I want to spend any time. But as long as I have a presence there I might as well try VisitMe. But I have no clue how to set it up. I can't find any help on this wiki.

Nor do I see the one step build (check out and deploy to the VisitMe server(s)) yet.

Nice job on the beta release! 

The page at
http://code.google.com/p/visitme/wiki/PublicBeta
has good bullets about what needs to be done before going public to a wider audience. I'd like to see these items scheduled.

I think it's time for a little more long range planning for the spring. The Future category on the schedule goes only as far as the end of November.

I don't see a one step build or a deployment description anywhere on the wiki (perhaps I haven't looked carefully enough). If the project were to stop suddenly right now (perhaps because the entire gopandas team got a team job offer they couldn't refuse) then Paul or anyone else ought to be able to come to this google code site and see immediately how to get and install the latest stable version of VisitMe. That should probably be a single file on the Downloads tab, created by a script if possible, or by easy to follow instructions if not, containing the latest version automatically checked out from svn and a readme with instructions, also checked out of svn. And of course the script itself should be from svn. (It could be on the wiki, since the wiki is backed up by the same svn as the code.)

I've corresponded with Paul about Kayak branding and the IP questions. Here's the resolution:

{{{
i've always been very clear that the code can and should be
published -- so the students can take this code and do anything they
want with it, including creating a competing site if they want. they
can name their version anything they want. but the version which goes
on our facebook page should be named a KAYAK app. don't you think that
sounds fair?
}}}

So make sure the UI you design for Kayak meets Kayak's spec - but design the interface between the UI and the code so that it's easy to rebrand (whether or not you ever get around to doing that). Your smarty architecture should make that easy.

You'll want to keep at least "powered by Kayak" in any version.

I see lots of new functionality requested at the October 30 client meeting. Do those all go into your first release? Consider maintaining a list of requested features in a single place so that you can prioritize and schedule them.

October 27.

The use case for Story6 doesn't seem to me to match the sample UI. The former calls for much more information than the latter has fields for.

Use cases should be separate from short stories (since one use case may be part of several stories, and a story may need more than one use case). You should also use a more traditional template, in which the user's actions and the system's responses are clearly separate.

----

October 22. I like the CodingGuidelines. You acknowledge that they're a customization of some you got from PHPBB. You should link to the original, and perhaps write a few words about the changes you made, and why.

Do you have a plan to enforce these guidelines? 

----

October 20. Why have dates in Hello World on the schedule been changed to WOC (waiting on client)? I can see why you might need that for the Kayak API, but for a simple facebook app hello world?

You should probably have dates even for the items that depend on things beyond your control (like client input) so you can record when you need or expect them by. That way you can track their effects on the rest of your schedule.

October 2. You are awesome.

October 2. I think your schedule should distinguish between major milestones and the intermediate milestones along the way. Perhaps color or font could do that without too much trouble. And you should schedule a few more of the major milestones so the schedule reaches out more than just a week or two.

# Introduction #
Since regular people will be using VisitME, it is important to make the UI as simple as possible.

The two integration points in Facebook that we will focus on are the canvas page, which will act as a place to get the core functionality working, as well as act as a hub for users to change their preferences, and the profile page, where we will place a box on the left column underneath the information box.

## Notes ##
After the initial UI was submitted, we were requested to make the application feel more like a Kayak application, along with more data displayed. The current profile box mockup is the result of that, which has been well received by the client.

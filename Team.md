## Role distribution ##
The following table describes which roles each team member is responsible for. These roles act more like priorities for workflow - every member should try to understand the knowledge required for as many roles as possible.

Each role is assigned at least two members (with the exception of Team Lead) in order to provide redundancy in case of extended absences.

| **Role**         | **Role Assigned to** |
|:-----------------|:---------------------|
| Team Lead      | Henrik |
| Facebook API   | Vasudev , Weiwei, Brian, Charlie |
| Kayak API      | Weiwei, Khanh |
| Graphic Design | Henrik, Charlie |
| Programmers    | Group |
| QA             | Vasudev, Brian, Khanh |

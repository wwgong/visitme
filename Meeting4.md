Meeting took place on 10/07/2009 at Bluefin Restaurant near Porter Square

## Summary ##

First of all, if you like Japanese cuisine, you should visit Blue fin (nice place, awesome food). This was an unplanned meeting. We went there to have food after client meeting, but it turned out to be a team meeting. We discussed following topics while having some awesome food.

We came up with a new [Team Name](TeamName.md) "GoPandas" which will also be used as a domain name. As per the client suggestion, we decided to remake the [Team Info](ContactInfo.md) page. We also figured out the roles that can be distributed within the team as follows:
  * Facebook API
  * Kayak API
  * Graphic designing
  * Risk Analysis
  * Programming
  * QA, Usability testing

We also finalized the [Short Story Titles](ShortStories.md) that we are going to consider. We are going to discuss more about the short stories in next meeting (on  10/08/2009).

All items and deadlines are detailed in the [schedule](Schedule.md)

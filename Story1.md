# Short Story: Paul visits Jim's profile #

Paul goes to Facebook and decides to click on Jim's profile, who was one of his fraternity brother in college and doesn't have VisitME installed. When viewing Jim's profile, Paul sees that Jim does not have VisitME installed. He then goes on to the VisitME application, where he can find a link to invite his friends to use the application as well as simply search for the flight cost by typing in Jim's name into the search bar.

On the canvas page, Paul is also presented with the option to "share" his search on his feed and notify the friends he searched for.

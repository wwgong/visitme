Meeting #5 took place on 10/08/2009 in class.

## Summary ##

In this meeting we discussed [6 short story titles](ShortStories.md) in detail that we came up in the Meeting #4 and also assigned a story to each member in the group. We also decided to document the roles as suggested by Paul. We also talked about the role distribution within the team. Each team member was allowed to pick the roles (at least 2 roles) that he is comfortable with.
